## Why this project

This project aims at sharing with the community those Java code I appreciate in the challenges and are helping you gain time, allowing you to develop in several files with a one click build, and sharing a common set of codes between challenges. Don't reinvent the wheel, focus on the subject!

## for developers:

Code uses the Java version 8.

I use eclipse as IDE, and the projects include directly a Maven project. You can also use Maven to build project files for various IDE
The source code is in the */src/main/java folder, and the tests are in the */src/test/java folder.
